## Overview
A typical résumé contains a _"summary"_ of relevant job experience and education, as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a cover letter and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential employer sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants. 
**The goal of this project is to create an online version of the résumé using HTML, CSS, and the minimum amount of JavaScript.**
